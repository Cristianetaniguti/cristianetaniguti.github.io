# Cris Taniguti (she/her) personal website

Hello! Welcome to my [personal webpage](https://cristianetaniguti.github.io/)! I´m a Ph.D in Genetics in Plant Breeding. My research has focus in statistical genetics, computational biology and polyploid species. Here, I present my blog and a overview of my profissional profile. Feel free to contact me for more information.

I used the great jekyll [Grape-Academic-Theme](https://github.com/chrjabs/Grape-Academic-Theme) to build this website.
