description: Hello! Welcome to my personal webpage! Here, I present my blog and an overview of my professional profile. I am a Ph.D. in Genetics in Plant Breeding. My research has focused on statistical genetics, computational biology, and polyploid species. I am from Brazil, but I currently live in Ithaca (NY - US) where I am the Genomics Coordinator at Breeding Insight - Cornell University. Outside of work, I love art performances and I have already performed aerial silk and other circus activities on streets, in theaters, and in open TV events.
