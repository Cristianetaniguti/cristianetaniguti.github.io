title: SNP and genotype calling - A practical guide 
description: (Under development) - This tutorial shows how to perform SNP calling in GBS data using Docker containers 
---

Here we use Docker containers to perform SNP calling with STACKs, Freebayes and GATK.

Before start, it is important to highlight that all software here presented has several parameters that can be adjusted for each given scenario. Here, we will use the default settings, but for the best usage of each one of them, it is important to explore their specificities. So... use it carefully!

## What you will need to run this tutorial

* Linux system
* At least 4G RAM
* At least 7G HD
* Docker
* Internet connection
