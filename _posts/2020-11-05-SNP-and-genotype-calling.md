Here we use Docker containers to perform SNP calling with GATK.

Before start, it is important to highlight that all software here presented has several parameters that can be adjusted for each given scenario. Here, we will use the default settings, but for the best usage of each one of them, it is important to explore their specificity. So... use it carefully!
